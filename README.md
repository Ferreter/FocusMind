# About Focus Mind

 - Focus Mind is an application made to help people increase their proditivity and focus. It is a desktop application that uses the Pomodoro Technique to help users focus on their work.
 - This is done by blocking certain websites and applications that are known to be distracting as well as blocking incoming notifications that may also lead users to become distracted.
 - This project was made with the help of DKIT's Pastoral Care Coordinator, Alan Conlon.
